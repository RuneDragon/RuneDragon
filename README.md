- 👋 Hi, I’m @RuneDragon
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and how computers work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to program in Python, but am getting dared to try Coq (Oh boy...)
- I have made a few games. One that was the most interesting was actually in scratch and seeing if I could do such: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/328951802/
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I simply want to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me: gcutcher@gmail.com or my Discord: Rune Dragon#5331
